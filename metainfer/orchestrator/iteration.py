"""Iteration folder management.

Layout (since the refactor):

* iteration CODE lives under ``<cwd>/<task_id>/<NNN>/`` — visible,
  top-level, not hidden.
* per-iteration LOGS (agent prompts, agent stdout/stderr, oracle reports,
  server logs) live under ``<logs_root>/<NNN>/`` where ``logs_root`` is
  typically ``<cwd>/.metainfer/logs/<task_id>/``.
* a snapshot of the previous iteration's diagnostic logs is copied forward
  into the new iteration's logs dir under ``<logs_root>/<NNN>/prev-iter/``
  so the next agent can root-cause the previous C step's failure.

Crash recovery: an iteration is "complete" once it has been closed cleanly
(success or failed). We mark that by writing a :data:`COMPLETED_SENTINEL`
file inside the iter CODE dir as the **last** write of the close path — so
an iteration whose folder lacks the sentinel was abandoned mid-flight by a
crashed orchestrator. :meth:`discard_latest_incomplete` removes the
highest-numbered such folder so a resume can restart that iteration from
scratch.
