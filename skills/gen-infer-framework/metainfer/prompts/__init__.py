NO_FRAMEWORK_REFERENCE_RULE = """# CRITICAL: no reading or copying from existing inference frameworks
You are building a framework FROM SCRATCH. The following are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN:

1. **Do not read, browse, grep, cat, or open** the source code of any
   existing inference engine — this includes (but is not limited to)
   vLLM, SGLang, TensorRT-LLM, TGI, ExLlamaV2, llama.cpp, LightLLM,
   DeepSpeed-MII, Aphrodite, OpenLLM, LMCache, or any of their forks.
   This applies whether the code is on disk, in a pip-installed package,
   on GitHub, or anywhere outside the current iteration directory.
2. **Do not import or call** non-operator code from those frameworks.
   No `from vllm import ...`, no `import sglang`, no copying their files
   into the iteration directory. The ONLY allowed dependency surface is
   - torch / numpy / scipy (the numerical primitives)
   - kernel libraries used as **leaf operators** (e.g. `flash_attn`,
     `xformers.ops`, a single CUTLASS / Triton kernel) — called directly
     for a math op, never extended or subclassed
   - HTTP server primitives (e.g. `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `http.server`)
     — used as transport, not copied
3. **Everything non-operator must be your own work**: the scheduler,
   the KV cache manager, the paged-attention allocator / block table,
   the request queue + continuous-batching loop, tokenizer-detokenizer
   streaming, the OpenAI-compatible request/response shaping, the weight
   loader, the dtype / quantization packaging. All of it — written from
   scratch inside the iteration directory.
4. **Stay inside the iteration directory and the notebooks/ knowledge base.**
   Do NOT read files outside the working directory. In particular, do NOT
   enumerate `/usr/lib/python*`, `site-packages/vllm/`, `site-packages/sglang/`,
   `~/.cache/`, or any third-party project tree. The ONLY reference material
   you may consult is:
     - the `notebooks/` directory pointed to below
     - files inside the current iteration directory

If you find yourself wanting to "see how vLLM does it" — STOP. That is
plagiarism. Re-read the relevant entry in `notebooks/` instead; if none
exists, design the component yourself from first principles. A clean,
slower, original implementation is always preferred over a fast copy."""

# Self-test mandate for the implementer (gen-infer-framework only).

IMPORT_SMOKE_TEST_MANDATE = """# MANDATORY import smoke test BEFORE booting the server (gen-infer-framework)
A huge fraction of failed iterations crash at IMPORT time (missing `import
torch`, circular import, syntax error, bad type annotation evaluated at
class-definition time, ...). These are 50-millisecond failures but if you
only catch them via the full server-boot smoke test below, you waste 30-60s
per retry and thrash for 10+ minutes. So before you even try to start the
server, gate on this:

1. From your iteration directory, run:
   ```
   python3 -c "import server"
   ```
   (Adjust the entry module to match whatever `serve.sh` invokes first —
   typically `server`, `engine`, `model`, `kvcache`, `attention`,
   `weight_loader`, `scheduler`, `sampler`, `sequence`, `config`. Importing
   `server` should transitively import all of them.)

2. If that command prints ANYTHING to stderr or exits non-zero, **you are
   not done — do not proceed to the server-boot smoke test**. The traceback
   names the exact file and line. Fix it, re-run the same one-liner, repeat
   until `python3 -c "import server"` exits 0 silently.

3. Only after the import smoke test passes cleanly, run the server-boot
   smoke test below.

This gate exists because the alternative (booting the server and waiting
for a health-check timeout) is 1000× slower and the iteration logs show
real runs burning 13+ minutes in B this way. Do not skip it."""

SMOKE_TEST_MANDATE = """# MANDATORY self-test before declaring B done (gen-infer-framework)
Before you finish, you MUST verify your server actually starts and answers
an OpenAI-style request. Do NOT hand off to C with an unbooted server.

Minimum bar — perform ALL of these locally inside the iteration directory:

0. **Import smoke test FIRST** — see the IMPORT_SMOKE_TEST_MANDATE section
   above. Do not run any of the steps below until `python3 -c "import server"`
   exits 0. Most "server won't boot" failures are actually import-time
   crashes that this one-liner catches instantly.
1. Start your server in the background on a free port:
   `PORT=127.0.0.1:0 ; # or pick any free localhost port`
   `bash serve.sh $PORT &`
2. Poll `GET /v1/models` (or `POST /v1/chat/completions` with a 1-token
   prompt) until it answers 200, or until ~60s have elapsed. Use only
   stdlib (`python -c "import urllib.request ..."`, `curl`) — no requests/
   httpx. Kill the server as soon as it answers.
3. If the server does NOT answer within 60s, or answers with a non-2xx
   status, or returns a response that does not contain
   `choices[0].message.content`, **you are NOT done**. Read
   `server.stderr.log` (redirect the server's stderr to a file when you
   launch it), fix the underlying problem, and re-run the smoke test.
4. Once the smoke test passes, kill the server and delete any background
   PID files you created. Do NOT leave processes running.

Only after the smoke test passes may you declare B complete. The next
phase (C) is an immutable oracle that does almost exactly this — if you
skip the self-test, C will fail and you will be back here next iteration
reading this same prompt. Save everyone the round-trip."""

    immutable oracle that boots your ``serve.sh`` and sends OpenAI-style

   - Takes the port as `$1` (e.g. `./serve.sh 8080`).
   - Starts your inference framework's HTTP server on that port.
   - Must expose an **OpenAI-compatible API**:
     * `POST /v1/chat/completions`  (required)
     * `POST /v1/completions`      (recommended)
     * `GET  /v1/models`           (recommended; used for health-check)
   - Must BLOCK in the foreground (no daemonize, no `&`) — the orchestrator's
     oracle owns process lifecycle and will SIGTERM/SIGKILL when done.
   - Must honor deterministic decoding (temperature=0, fixed seed) where
     the framework supports it; the oracle sends temperature=0 requests.
   - Request/response bodies must follow the OpenAI schema. At minimum the
     chat completion response must contain
     `choices[0].message.content` as a string.

   ## Model path resolution (CRITICAL — read carefully)
   The real model weights live at: `{target_model}`
   The orchestrator's oracle launches your serve.sh as `bash serve.sh <port>`
   and sets the env var `MODEL_DIR={target_model}`. Your serve.sh MUST
   resolve the model directory in this order:
     1. Positional argument `$2` (if provided)
     2. Env var `$MODEL_DIR`
     3. **A hardcoded default baked in from the requirements above** —
        i.e. literally `DEFAULT_MODEL_DIR="{target_model}"` near the top
        of the script, used when neither $2 nor $MODEL_DIR is set.

   ## Mock mode is FORBIDDEN as a silent fallback
   You MAY include a `--mock` flag for local smoke testing without a GPU,
   BUT the server must NEVER silently fall back to mock / echo mode when
   the real model is missing. If the model dir is missing or empty:
     - print a clear error to stderr naming the path that was tried, AND
     - exit non-zero.
   Do NOT auto-enable mock mode based on `ls *.safetensors` failing, do
   NOT auto-degrade to "echo back the prompt" responses, do NOT return
   200 with a `[MetaInfer mock]` prefix. Any of these is a CRITICAL bug:
   the oracle's LLM-judge will mark every case as fail because the
   response is obviously not real model output, and you will burn every
   remaining iteration the same way.

   The orchestrator runs an **immutable oracle** (outside `{iter_dir}`,
   you cannot see or modify it) which:
     1. starts `serve.sh <port>` on a free localhost port,
     2. waits for `/v1/models` (or a probe to `/v1/chat/completions`),
     3. sends a fixed set of prompts via HTTP,
     4. dispatches a separate judge sub-agent to verdict each response,
     5. kills the server and writes `oracle-report.json`.

   You do NOT write the test, the prompts, or the judge. Only `serve.sh`
   plus whatever Python/C++ your framework needs.

2. **Fix ONE root cause per attempt.** If multiple things look wrong,
   pick the one the failure reason actually points at. The next repair
   attempt (if needed) can address the next symptom.
3. **Minimal diff.** Use Edit, not Write. Do not rewrite whole functions
   unless the bug is structural. Do not touch files unrelated to the
   failure.
4. **Verify locally before exiting** (gen-infer-framework): run
   `python3 -c "import server"` from the iteration directory first. If
   that fails with a traceback, fix the import error before doing
   anything else — the orchestrator's C re-run will fail instantly on
   an import error and waste this repair attempt. After the import
   check passes, do a quick local server-boot smoke (start `serve.sh`
   on a free port, poll `/v1/models`, kill it). See
   `IMPORT_SMOKE_TEST_MANDATE` / `SMOKE_TEST_MANDATE` principles from the
   implementer's contract — same rules apply here.
5. **Do NOT re-run the full oracle / test.sh yourself.** That's the

`c-repairs.jsonl` for post-run forensics. Without this file the repair
is treated as "no diagnosis recorded" and the next attempt loses
context. Use EXACTLY this section structure (markdown):

# C-step repair attempt {attempt}/{max_attempts}

## Error reason (input)
<one paragraph: what the failing C step reported — quote the specific
error message, traceback frame, or judge verdict that triggered this
repair. Do NOT paste the whole failure block verbatim; summarize the
operative symptom.>

## Root cause hypothesis
<one paragraph: what you believe is the underlying bug. Cite file:line.
If you considered and rejected alternative hypotheses, name them and
say why you picked this one.>

## Fix applied
<bullet list of concrete edits, each as `path/to/file.py:LINE — <what
changed>`. Only the files you actually touched. Examples:
- `engine.py:142` — guard against empty `layers` list before indexing
- `sampler.py:88` — cast temperature to float before comparison>

## Verification
<one paragraph: what local check(s) you ran (import smoke, server-boot
probe, manual request) and what you observed. If a check failed and you
fixed it before exiting, note that too.>

## Expected next-step outcome
<one sentence: "C re-run should now pass because <reason>" OR "C re-run
will likely still fail on <X>; the next attempt should focus on <Y>".>

     through: `MODEL_DIR="<target_model from requirements>" bash serve.sh $PORT`
     (the correctness oracle does this for you; perf.sh must do it itself).
   - Wait until `/v1/models` answers 200 (poll with stdlib only).
   - Run a HEAVIER benchmark than the correctness pass:
     * at least 16 distinct prompts (mix short + long output)
     * measure under concurrent requests (e.g. a thread/process pool of
       4-16 workers via `concurrent.futures`)
     * include a warmup phase (drop the first N requests before measuring)
     * tokenize output with the model's own tokenizer OR approximate with
       a len-of-text heuristic if the tokenizer isn't easily reachable
   - Kill the server cleanly and emit perf_report.json next to the script.

2. Run `perf.sh` yourself (you have shell access). Capture its output.

3. Write `{iter_dir}/perf_report.json` (or have perf.sh write it directly)
   with EXACTLY this shape (all numbers are floats):

   ```json
   {{
     "tokens_per_sec": <throughput across all concurrent reqs>,
     "ms_per_request": <mean end-to-end latency>,
     "p50_ms": <p50 latency>,

   }}
   ```

   The orchestrator will parse this and feed it to the next agent (F) and
   to the next iteration's planner. Output that doesn't parse → INFRA_FAIL.

4. ALSO print exactly one JSON line to stdout (same shape) so the orchestrator
   can capture perf without re-parsing the file:

   On failure: `{{"passed": false, "error": "<short>", "traceback": "<last 4KB>"}}`
